      "content": "A standard Rubik's Cube has 6 faces, each with a different color. The white face is traditionally considered the starting point for solving. Each face can rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Understanding the structure is crucial before you start solving.\n\nThe cube has the following notation for moves:\n- U: Top (Up) face clockwise\n- U' (read as \"U prime\"): Top face counterclockwise\n- D: Bottom (Down) face clockwise\n- D' (read as \"D prime\"): Bottom face counterclockwise\n- L: Left face clockwise\n- L' (read as \"L prime\"): Left face counterclockwise\n- R: Right face clockwise\n- R' (read as \"R prime\"): Right face counterclockwise\n- F: Front face clockwise\n- F' (read as \"F prime\"): Front face counterclockwise\n- B: Back face clockwise\n- B' (read as \"B prime\"): Back face counterclockwise\n\nNote: The prime symbol (') indicates a counterclockwise rotation of the face. For example, F' is read as \"F prime\" and means to rotate the front face counterclockwise.",

      "content": "Now that you've identified the white edges, let's solve the white cross. The white cross is formed when all four white edge pieces are correctly positioned with white on top and the adjacent colors matching the center pieces of the respective faces.\n\nHere's the general approach:\n1. Find a white edge piece\n2. Position it so the non-white color aligns with the matching center piece\n3. Use the appropriate algorithm to move it into the correct position on the white face\n4. Repeat for all four white edges\n\nHere's a specific algorithm to place a white edge without disturbing other already placed white edges:\n\nIf the edge piece is on the bottom layer with white facing down:\n1. Rotate the bottom face (D) to position the edge directly below its destination position\n2. Perform F2 (turning the front face twice) to move it to the correct position\n\nIf the edge piece is on the bottom layer with white facing the side:\n1. Rotate the bottom face (D) to position the edge below any face that isn't its destination\n2. Perform a sequence like (R' D' R) to bring the edge to the bottom with white facing down\n3. Now use the method above to place it correctly\n\nIf the edge piece is already on the top layer but incorrectly oriented:\n1. Use F R' D' R F' to bring it down to the bottom layer\n2. Then use one of the methods above to place it correctly\n\nThis systematic approach ensures you can build the white cross without undoing your previous work.",

The key is understanding why we position and repeat the algorithm.\n\nA common algorithm for placing a white corner is:\nR' D' R D\n\nWhen a white corner needs to be placed, we first position it directly beneath its target slot. This is crucial because:\n1. The algorithm will cycle the corner piece between this position and the slot above\n2. Each repetition rotates the corner piece differently\n3. We can keep repeating until the white face is oriented upward\n\nThink of it like a door that can only swing in one direction - by positioning the corner below its slot and repeating the sequence, we're essentially \"knocking\" on that door until it opens the right way.\n\nHere's the approach:\n1. Find where the corner needs to go based on its other colors\n2. Position that corner piece in the bottom layer directly below its target slot\n3. Apply the algorithm (R' D' R D) and watch how the corner rotates\n4. Keep repeating until the white sticker faces up and slots perfectly\n5. Move on to the next corner",
